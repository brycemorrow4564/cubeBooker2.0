# cubeBooker2.0
Python script to automate study cube bookings

This was a project that I initally started during my freshman year of college. 
Programming as a whole was still relatively new to me and I had just started 
learning Python. My first solution, while functional, was very "hacky" and 
didn't exercise good object oriented design principles. This version of 
the project is in the file testfile.py. 

After a few more programming classes and a lot of time spend learning on my own, 
I've come back to this project as sort of a benchmark for my own personal growth. 
I'm currently in the process of rebuilding this program from scratch using more 
advanced design principles and language features and I'm excited to see how much 
improve upon my first attempt. This new version of the project is 
in the file bookerV2.py.
